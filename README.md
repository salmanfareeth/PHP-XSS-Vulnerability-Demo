# PHP XSS Vulnerability Demo

This repository contains a simple PHP program that demonstrates a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The program includes a form that allows users to submit a comment, which is then displayed on a webpage without proper sanitization, allowing potential script injection.

## Description

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS vulnerabilities occur when an application includes untrusted data in a web page without proper validation or escaping, enabling attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser.

This demo illustrates how an XSS attack can be executed by submitting a comment containing a script tag. The script will be executed by the browser when the comment is rendered, demonstrating the vulnerability.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need:

- A web server with PHP support (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or a local PHP server).
- PHP installed on your server or local machine.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/salmanfareeth/PHP-XSS-Vulnerability-Demo.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```sh
    cd PHP-XSS-Vulnerability-Demo
    ```

3. **Move the Files to Your Web Server's Document Root:**
   
   - For Apache, the document root is usually `/var/www/html/` on Linux or `C:\xampp\htdocs\` on Windows.
   - Move the files to your server's document root directory.

4. **Start Your Web Server:**

   - Ensure your web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) is running.

5. **Open `phpforxss.php` in a Web Browser:**

   - Navigate to `http://localhost/phpforxss.php` or the appropriate URL for your setup.

## Files

- `phpforxss.php`: The main PHP file containing the form and logic to display comments.

## Security Note

This code is intentionally vulnerable to demonstrate the XSS issue. In a real-world scenario, always sanitize and escape user input before displaying it on a webpage to prevent such vulnerabilities. Use functions like `htmlspecialchars()` in PHP to escape HTML characters. This project is created by `salmanfareeth`.
